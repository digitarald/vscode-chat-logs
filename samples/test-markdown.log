digitarald: Test the markdown rendering with tool calls

GitHub Copilot: I'll help you test the **markdown rendering**. Here's what we'll do:

1. First, I'll check the current code
2. Then I'll make some changes
3. Finally, we'll verify it works

Let me start by reading the file:

Read [](file:///Users/digitarald/Developer/vscode-chat-logs/src/components/ChatMessage.tsx#1-50)

Now I can see the code. The component has the following features:

- **Markdown support** with `react-markdown`
- Tool call rendering with expand/collapse
- Proper styling with Tailwind CSS

Let me navigate to the page to test it:

Ran Navigate to a URL
Completed with input: {"url": "http://localhost:3000"}

Great! The page is loading. Now let me click on a test button:

Ran Click
Completed with input: {"element": "Test button", "ref": "e123"}

Perfect! Everything is working. Here's a summary:

### Test Results ✅

| Feature | Status |
|---------|--------|
| Markdown | ✅ Working |
| Tool Calls | ✅ Working |
| Styling | ✅ Working |

The implementation includes:

```typescript
const renderContent = () => {
  return segments.map(segment => {
    if (segment.type === 'text') {
      return <ReactMarkdown>{segment.content}</ReactMarkdown>;
    }
  });
};
```

You can now use `inline code` and even [links](https://github.com) in your messages!
